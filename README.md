## Getting displaying Data from the [Marvel Developer API](https://developer.marvel.com/)

This is my first attempt of handling data retrived from an API. :bowtie:

## Try this :poo: out! 

Type for example ***spider-man*** in the searchfield and press ***search*** then after a short while
some data should appear below the input area!
